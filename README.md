# Semester 1 Assignments and Project Ideas

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local system.
3. Add your work and **create a Pull Request (PR)** back to this repository.

## Folder Structure

* Each student must create a folder inside the repository.
* The folder should be named in the following format:

  ```
  <University GR Number>-<Student Name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```
  101008-StudentName
  ```

## Assignment Format

* Inside your personal folder, create subject-wise README files for each assignment.

* File naming convention should be:

  ```
  00.subject.md
  ```

  Example:

  ```
  00.figma.md
  ```

* Each assignment file must include:

  * **Date of submission**
  * **Assignment URL** (for example, in the case of Figma, include the public exported file link).


Would you like me to also add a **sample folder and file structure tree** in the README so students clearly understand how their submission should look?
